              <ul class="dash">
                <li>This was the first Dystopian Future novel I had ever read, and opened my eyes to a whole new world of content</li>
                <li>I was especially impressed with the world that Orwell had created, and the detail put into the government's structure</li>
                <li>I usually read a chapter a night, but by the last few chapters I was stuck to the novel and finished it all in one sitting</li>

              <ul class="dash">
                <li>This novel, originally written in Russian, was the first translated media I had ever read; Although, a difficult task at times</li>
                <li>Many chapters were quite dense, and I often struggled to understand the plot due to the language</li>
                <li>I obtained some outside sources in order to help me grasp the text, as I felt I was missing key details</li>
                <li>Overall, the payoff was excellent, as the ending of this story felt magical, and I cannot wait to read it again</li>

                <li>This novel, similar to The M&M, felt extremely magical at times</li>
                <li>I enjoyed this story, as it focused on the main characters inner thoughts, even personifying them into another character named "crow"</li>
                <li>Originally written in Japanese, there were many Western references  within the story, and it was interesting to read from my westernized perspective</li>

              <li>Usually, I am not a fan of post-apocalyptic stories, however, this book entails so much more than that  </li>
              <li>I enjoyed this story as it allowed me to reflect on who the "bad guys" really are; I found myself at times sympathizing with the vampires</li>
              <li>As well, the ending was one of the best I had ever read</li>

              <li>This was an excellent read, however at times a bit too sad for my liking</li>
              <li>I enjoyed the subtle connections that the book would make with itself, most notably the lines spoken at the end of the final chapter</li>
              <li>This novel also opened my eyes to many of the troubles countries are facing across the world, some of which we don't even hear about in North America</li>

                <li>Similar to 1984, this novel amazed me in the world that was created, and the mechanisms used by the government to control its citizens</li>
                <li>However, I was not extremely impressed with the ending. The beginning of this book is definitely my favourite aspect</li>
